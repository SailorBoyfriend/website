    <b>01. "Teleplay"</b><br><br>
    
    Your red burns through my head<br>
    Before I close my eyes<br>
    RECORDs of the real world<br><br>

    I had dreams of what seemed, oh-oh<br>
    Like the real world, like the real world<br><br>

    You make me watch chemistry<br>
    Test patterns that we can't see<br>
    It's all that you writ<br>
    It's all in the script of the teleplay<br><br>

    I heard they can get by through<br>
    Life without drugs, oh-oh<br>
    In the real world, like the real world<br><br>

    They don't need to PAUSE their scene<br>
    To regain their normalcy<br>
    I know, I know, I know, I know<br><br>

    You make me watch chemistry<br>
    Test patterns that we can't see<br>
    It's all that you writ<br>
    It's all in their script of the teleplay<br><br>

    If we're so off, why can't we turn it on?<br>
    Going through motions 'till we break static dawn<br>
    Channel flipping, tidal-shifting, should we STOP?<br><br>

    <i>Words by Alex Mercuri and Andy Waldron</i><br><br>
    
    Don't feel bad, it's really not your fault<br>
    I just hate everyone when I'm alone too long<br>
    And I can try and dance around it all<br>
    But I can't be cool if I'm dodging your calls<br>

    Fell asleep at the bar and woke up in<br>
    Capoeira Class<br>
    I was wearing your lipstick, I think<br>
    Capoeira Class<br>
    Capoeira Class<br>
    Capoeira Class<br>
    Capoeira Class<br><br>

    You left your eyelash on my chest<br>
    I kept it there -- love being your mess<br>
    Tried to sleep but potential's in my head<br>
    Stared at the wall while thoughts ran 'round the bed<br><br>

    Fell asleep at the bar and woke up in<br>
    Capoeira Class<br>
    I was wearing your lipstick, I think<br>

    <b>03. American Goblin</b><br>
    <i>Words by Alex Mercuri and Andy Waldron</i><br><br>

    Down, down in the underground, he's looking so profound<br>
    Lack of chill with a five band bill he booked<br>
    These guys from out of state are running unfashionably late<br>
    The American Goblin hobbles back to look<br><br>

    And see if Suzy Lee has answered his eight texts<br>
    While his PA plays some Replacements<br>
    Complains in vain to some friend through his vape pen,<br>
    "This is what The Scene's all about: none of the twist but all of the shout!"<br><br>

    "Come thru!"<br>
    "Come thru!"<br><br>

    You can tell by the overalls, devilock, insecurity<br>
    All he's sewn proudly on his sleeve<br>
    Halfway through a Facebook post, beggin' for community<br>
    She walks on by with a bass, his gaze reaches to her knees<br><br>

    Asks the girl in the Erg t-shirt if she's heard of Mikey Erg<br>
    She sighs and rolls her eyes, see ya's and beelines<br>
    He can't believe she's the instrumental lead<br>
    The only thing built to spill out his dictionary mouth:<br><br>

    "Come thru!"<br>
    "Come thru!" (Please, please, please, let him be misunderstood)<br>
    "Come thru!" (Please, please, please, let him be misunderstood)<br>
    "Come thru!" (Please, please, please, let him be misunderstood)<br><br>

    "Please, please, please, let me be misunderstood"<br>
    "She's actually pretty skillfully"<br>
    "Tattoo across my left shoe: Morrissey, Mac, Jeff and Magnum, Brian"<br>
    "Tattoo across my left shoe: Rivers, Issac, Henry"<br><br>

    He'll gargle his strife to cut through the noise like a butter knife<br>
    In a funhouse mirror to an audience of one<br>
    We'll bite our tongues to sing without doing anything<br>
    Pay to play our place, the space is safe if it is for him<br><br>

    Well, whatcha gonna do?<br>
    "Come thru!"<br>
    "Come thru!" (Please, please, please, let him be misunderstood)<br>
    "Come thru!" (Please, please, please, let him be misunderstood)<br>
    "Come thru!" (Please, please, please, let him be misunderstood)<br>
    "Come thru!"<br><br>

    <b>04. "Science Fiction / Double Feature"</b><br>
    <i> Words by Richard O'Brien</i><br><br>
    
    Michael Rennie was ill the day the Earth stood still, but he told us where we stand<br>
    And Flash Gordon was there in silver underwear; Claude Rains was The Invisible Man<br>
    Then something went wrong for Fay Wray and King Kong, they got caught in a celluloid jam<br>
    Then at a deadly pace, it came from outer space, and this is how the message ran...<br><br>
    
    Science fiction, double feature<br>
    Doctor X will build a creature<br>
    See androids fighting Brad and Janet<br>
    Anne Francis stars in Forbidden Planet<br>
    Whoa oh oh oh oh oh<br>
    At the late night double feature picture show<br><br>
    
    I knew Leo G. Carroll was over a barrel when Tarantula took to the hills<br>
    And I really got hot when I saw Janette Scott fight a Triffid that spits poison and kills<br>
    Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes, and passing them used lots of skills<br>
    But when worlds collide, said George Pal to his bride,<br>
    "I'm gonna give you some terrible thrills"<br>
    Like a...<br><br>
    
    Science fiction (oh oh oh) double feature (wanna go)<br>
    Doctor X (oh oh oh) will build a creature (RKO)<br>
    See androids fighting (oh oh oh) Brad and Janet (the back row)<br>
    Anne Francis stars in (oh oh oh) Forbidden Planet<br>
    Whoa oh oh oh oh oh<br>
    At the late night, double feature, picture show, I wanna go!<br>
    At the late night, double feature, picture show, in the back row<br>
    Oh oh oh, to the late night, double feature, picture show<br><br>

    <b>01. "Behave"</b><br><br>
    
    Hello, hello, hello, is this first time that you're here?<br>
    The dead look in your eyes tells me this is not too queer for you<br><br>

    You dress so vanilla but you've made the switch<br>
    From one who follows orders to the office bitch<br>
    You choose to abuse the exact same way<br>
    Your boss does to you with a higher salary<br><br>

    The whips, the chains, the tension enslaves<br>
    The lips remain, directions, behave<br>
    The whips, the chains, the tension enslaves<br>
    The lips remain, directions, behave<br><br>

    Tied around your collar is the sweat of all your peers<br>
    Cufflinked in your H.R.? A report of all your fears<br><br>

    You walk around on fours like an Irish bull<br>
    You made sure to consent 'cause you're not an animal<br>
    You tag the motivational poster to say:<br>
    "There's power in love, but not the other way"<br><br>

    The whips, the chains, the tension enslaves<br>
    The lips remain, directions, behave<br>
    The whips, the chains, the tension enslaves<br>
    The lips remain, directions, behave<br><br>

    The whips, the chains, the tension enslaves<br>
    The lips remain, directions, behave<br>
    The hips, the brain, the tension enslaves<br>
    The whips remain, directions, behave<br><br>

    Hooked up to a sensor just to show you how I feel<br>
    The words they just come easier prescribed<br><br>

    Something unidentified, sometimes I feel the same<br>
    The half life's getting shorter every day<br><br>

    There's something in our skies my lizard brain cannot convey<br>
    Exhausting to explain the way the saucers rise and fade<br><br>

    Another half-life! Another half-life!<br>
    Another half-life! Oh-oh!<br>
    Another half-life! Another half-life!<br>
    Another half-life! Oh-oh!<br>

    <b>03. "Young Adult Novel"</b><br><br>
    
    Do you ever feel like the walls they built around our town<br>
    Are a bit too high and are never coming down?<br>
    Do you ever feel like the broadcast systems that play on the hour<br>
    Are a bit too loud to resist 'em?<br><br>

    'Cause I've been watching, and they've been talking<br>
    And we've been wanting to get away from the fallen<br><br>

    Do you ever feel like we're living in a dystopian young adult novel?<br>
    Do you ever feel like we're living in a dystopian young adult novel?<br>
    Or is that just the bottle?<br><br>

    Do you ever feel like the feeling when we hold hands<br>
    Is, uh, somethin' indescribable to any of our friends?<br>
    Do you ever feel like there's some narrow narrative that we're supposed to follow --<br>
    Some heteronormative imperative?<br><br>

    'Cause I've been watching and they've been talking<br>
    And we've been wanting to get away from the fallen<br><br>

    Do you ever feel like we're living in a dystopian young adult novel?<br>
    Do you ever feel like we're living in a dystopian young adult novel?<br>
    Or is that just the bottle?<br><br>

    If you're the chosen one they seek<br>
    If you're the king, I'll be your queen<br>
    If you're the sunken hero, I'll be the comic relief<br><br>

    The speech you gave at the promenade<br>
    Knocked us over with a wind that could blow the good wall down<br>
    My fear lies in the aftermath<br>
    Well, do you have a plan? (And do you ever feel?)<br>
    You know, I'd hate to ask, is any of this real?<br><br>

    Do you ever feel like we're living in a dystopian young adult novel?<br>
    Do you ever feel like we're living in a dystopian young adult novel?<br>
    Or is that just the bottle<br><br>

    That you refused and I did drink<br>
    For all these thoughts, I doublethink:<br>
    Why'd we disappear when it's damn near utopian here?<br><br>

    To idolize and lionize, to elevate or alienate<br>
    To speak truth to power when their truth is hate<br>
    When they can't be bothered to fairly pay the sewers<br>
    Of fatal curtain calls in their safe space<br><br>

    No! No more heroes<br>
    No! No more heroes<br>
    In a culture of comic books, here's the lesson you can take:<br>
    No more heroes 'till we all get capes<br><br>

    When the Duke and his horsemen storm the castle at night<br>
    When the only lesson they can teach to the working classes is to blow out this little light<br>
    Your silence is a siren I can't make out<br>
    From all this white noise in Dolby Surround<br><br>

    No! No more heroes<br>
    No! No more heroes<br>
    In a culture of comic books, here's the lesson you can take:<br>
    No more heroes 'till we all get capes<br><br>

    So forgo and embrace your reality 'cause you know it needs some love<br>
    When the phone booth to change consists of windowpanes -- nowhere to run<br>
    Become a vessel and levitate us to a higher ground<br>
    Learn when to shut your mouth and when to join the chorus and shout<br><br>

    No! No more heroes<br>
    No! No more heroes<br>
    In a culture of comic books, here's the lesson you can take:<br>
    No more heroes 'till we all get capes<br><br>

    We choose to violate what we used to hide<br>

    Ain't it something to be: a kindhearted oddity?<br>
    It seems what's next isn't as clear cut as it seems<br><br>

    And I don't ask for much<br>
    And I don't want much more<br>

    I'll take the public display while you affect the transit<br>

    You make me feel dumb in the best way<br>
    And I could stare all night and read what you say<br>
    My heart is sunk, before it wrecks<br>
    I lick the envelope with my baited breath<br><br>

    But babe we're so beyond that tired, old lust<br>
    So let's make like shadows on the wall<br>
    And get vicarious<br><br>

    Sweet talkin' the void<br>
    Profess your love in a vacuum<br>
    Means nothing at all<br>
    Kind of fun to lay it all on you<br>
    So here we go<br><br>

    Sweet nothings, specters of affection<br>
    Haunt the LED's, but babe I'm crashin'<br>
    Crush the glass, try to see it clearer<br>
    But what's underneath looks like a mirror<br><br>

    Oh my love, it's been so long since we've seen any sun<br>

    Oh my love, I wouldn't say our flame has died<br>

    Our lips in orbit<br>
    Our lips in orbit<br>
    Our lips in orbit<br><br>

    Heavy pressure left you weary<br>
    Pushed me towards some theory<br>
    Led to an eclipse<br>
    When there's doubt about our distance<br>
    Shadows cross in the midst of changing light<br>
    (Don't lose sight!)<br><br>

    Our lips in orbit<br>
    Our lips in orbit<br>
    Our lips in orbit<br><br>

    So I cling to the orbit and try not to stray<br>
    As we get further from each other everyday<br>
    You brought the sun when it felt man-made<br>
    It feels like summer again<br><br>

    So I cling to the orbit and try not to stray<br>
    As we get further from each other everyday<br>
    It will never seem so far away knowing we'll be close again<br><br>

    <b>02. "Do You Like Sonic Youth?"</b><br>
    <i>Words by Alex Mercuri and Andy Waldron</i><br><br>

    Do you like Sonic Youth?<br>
    I've been trying to get to them too<br>
    I saw Lee Ranaldo at Kino Kimino<br>
    So I figured I'd ask you, where should I start?<br>
    'Cause I only know "Superstar"<br>
    Is there someone I gotta prove?<br>
    And so I wanted to ask you<br><br>

    Do you like Sonic Youth?<br>
    I got Kim Gordon's memoir<br>
    Haven't read it yet, but it's spent sunsets way back in the armoire<br>
    Next to a copy of "M Train" lying on my bedside and my Mike Kelley MoMA PS1 Exhibition Guide<br>
    If I buy five of your zines, can I be a part of your scene, and do they like Sonic Youth?<br><br>

    Hey, you in the Guided By Voices t-shirt, you know, every time I try to ask someone where I should start listening to that band, they give you, like, SIX albums.<br>
    And, you know what? I don't have the time or energy to listen to, like, SIX.<br>
    I mean, I got bills, I got thrills – I'm just tryna listen to music that my friends believe in so maybe I could understand them a little better, y'know?<br>
    But it's people like you and your gatekeeping crew, with your BIG record collections that are just bringing me down, man.<br><br>

    Do you like Sonic Youth?<br>
    They've been hounding me all my life!<br>
    They've influenced every band I like since they blew up in marital strife<br>
    I've heard Thurston's a bad guy and I know all punk's not white<br>
    But I think context is vital, so I'll be sure not to idolize<br><br>

    Ain't worth looking back and feelin' rosy<br><br>

    Tell me Peter, Peter Pan,<br>
    What's it like in Neverland?<br>
    What's the property tax like?<br>
    Is Tinker Bell cat-called all night?<br>

    Hey there, Peter, Peter Pan,<br>
    You and I share somethin' kid:<br>
    You wish you could never grow up,<br>
    Sometimes I wish I never did<br><br>

    I never did!<br><br>

    We can't rewrite the past<br>
    But the pain, it won't last<br>
    You'll dig deep among the leaves<br>
    And find accountability<br><br>

    <b>01. "Future Relic"</b><br><br>
    
    Watch out, in the frame<br>
    As I construct my name, you do the same<br>
    After two years apart, we share a room<br>
    But I've never felt so distant from you<br>
    So do,<br><br>

    (Do you want me?)<br>
    You're beckoning me to come<br>
    (Do you want me?)<br>
    But you're the one I'm running from<br>
    (Do you want me?)<br>
    Maybe this will do the trick<br>
    Future relic<br><br>

    Wait up, before we go,<br>
    Are you my hand to hold, when I'm alone?<br>
    Tell me, who held the reins<br>
    When I sang from the couch so everyone got paid?<br><br>

    (Do you want me?)<br>
    You're beckoning me to come<br>
    (Do you want me?)<br>
    But, the grift you give is just a crumb<br>
    (Do you want me?)<br>
    Maybe this will do the trick<br>
    (Do you want me?)<br>
    Am I a future relic?<br><br>

    It's a new day: I won't pay to play<br>
    It's a new day: I won't pay to play<br>
    It's a new day: I won't pay to play<br><br>

    <b>02. "Ammonia Factory"</b><br><br>
    
    Passed out on the floor as the Earth rotates<br>
    Each day I'm awake is a failure by the state<br>
    Is He looking down upon us<br>
    There, chain-smoking on the cross?<br><br>

    I can hear the parked cars snore carbon<br>
    'cross from the graveyard, they can fin'lly get some quiet<br>
    One awakes, fails to alarm the others<br>
    You can scream in this town and no-one bothers<br><br>

    "Hey, you down there, making me look bad,<br>
    Where's the drive from when you first applied?"<br><br>

    So I'm here on the floor as each hand rotates<br>
    Spending another day at Ammonia Factory<br>
    I'd complain, but that won't make me look tough<br>
    (Besides) everything's fatal if you wait around long enough<br><br>

    <b>03. "Sanctify"</b><br><br>
    
    Coming down hard, there's something I can't see<br>
    Can't be, can't be, can't be, can't be the sound<br>
    Got a postcard: a little clarity<br>
    Can we, can we, can we, can we, be found?<br><br>

    Watching all the planes go by and wishing one of them was mine<br>
    It's enough to make you sanctify, sanctify, c'mon, sanctify, my love<br><br>

    Losing my guard and finally set free<br>
    To be, to be, to be, to be homebound<br>
    Coming down hard, intensified breathing<br>
    Could be, could be, could be, could be left drowned -- profound<br><br>

    In the midst of holy war, your God and Country's less assured<br>
    Not enough to get us sanctified, oh no, sanctify, don't you sanctify our love<br><br>

    Watching all the planes go by and wishing one of them was mine<br>
    It's enough to make you sanctify, sanctify, c'mon, sanctify, my love<br><br>

    <b>04. "The Reception in Hell Leaves Something to Be Desired"</b><br><br>
    
    Touched by God in the car, reported her to H.R.<br>
    They sat us down, we had a talk; told me she was just a jock<br>
    Always putting in the care: cushion on an electric chair<br>
    I cannot be convinced that there is reform for this<br><br>

    I wanna burn it down like a tidal wave<br>
    Throw the lighter and then walk away<br>
    Some warm smile I'm meant to leave<br>
    With the letter drawn for no-one to read<br><br>

    Always work to be done right when you come undone<br>
    Tied up like a surgeon's knot: happy, young, something fraught<br>
    The alarm was too loud, so I took the batt'ry out<br>
    As smoke filled the room, I could finally take a snooze<br><br>

    I wanna burn it down like a tidal wave<br>
    Throw the lighter and then walk away<br>
    Some warm smile I'm meant to leave<br>
    With the letter drawn for no-one to read<br><br>

    <b>05. "Relief"</b><br><br>
    
    This conveyer belt could run for days but never find relief<br>
    I thank God then for its persistence in make, makeshift sheets<br>
    To cover all the bruises and the scabs we pick<br>
    Stuck knowing that his adhesive is impermanent<br><br>

    It's a dream job that's become a nightmare he can't wake up from<br>
    Long as he's exhausted by conditions that have left him numb<br>
    We have the ability to heal when they conceal and cast aside the unclad<br>
    This conveyer belt could run for days, but, alone, he won't find no relief<br><br>

    Distant drums of impending worksong are rattling these cold, brass gates<br>
    If music is your religion, then this is our heresy<br><br>

    <b>06. "Retail Therapy"</b><br><br>
    
    You joked and called me an electric blanket<br>
    Technically warm, ultimately synthetic<br>
    I thought it was funny, but then I made the choice<br>
    To say "I love you" with my customer service voice<br><br>

    You told me to unclench my jaw in bed<br>
    I came not with a bang but the exhale of a shift's end<br>
    We fold our arms, set our alarms, stare into night's abyss<br>
    And dream our dreams in Corporate Memphis<br><br>

    We used to root for office romance on our TV<br>
    Now it only reminds me of the work that's due next week<br>
    We paid to put a roof over our heads, but now I see<br>
    How I never thought to nurture what was underneath<br><br>

    Maybe I'll quit my job and start this song over<br>
    Focus on our love and the malaise I have incurred<br>
    To chip away not at the flaws, but at the artifice<br>
    To uncover the real me, is it covered by your insurance?<br><br>
